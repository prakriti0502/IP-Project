        <p id="c1">Women's health refers to the health of women, which differs from that of men in many unique ways. Women's health is an example of population health, where health is defined by the World Health Organization as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". Often treated as simply women's reproductive health, many groups argue for a broader definition pertaining to the overall health of women, better expressed as "The health of women". These differences are further exacerbated in developing countries where women, whose health includes both their risks and experiences, are further disadvantaged.</p>
        
        <p id="c2">Women's reproductive and sexual health has a distinct difference compared to men's health. Even in developed countries pregnancy and childbirth are associated with substantial risks to women with maternal mortality accounting for more than a quarter of a million deaths per year, with large gaps between the developing and developed countries. Comorbidity from other non reproductive disease such as cardiovascular disease contribute to both the mortality and morbidity of pregnancy, including preeclampsia. Sexually transmitted infections have serious consequences for women and infants, with mother-to-child transmission leading to outcomes such as stillbirths and neonatal deaths, and pelvic inflammatory disease leading to infertility. In addition infertility from many other causes, birth control, unplanned pregnancy, unconsensual sexual activity and the struggle for access to abortion create other burdens for women.</p>
        <h1>SOME MAJOR HEALTH ISSUES ARE:-</h1>
        <h2 id="pk1">1. Breast Cancer:</h2>

        <img src="br.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
        </div>
        <p>Otherwise known as the C word. The presence of cancer in Indian women has become increasingly prevalent. According to a recent report by the World Health Organisation, one in twelve women will develop cancer at some point in their life. This disease will especially be rampant in metro cities such as Mumbai and Delhi. </p>
        <p>Two main types of cancers that are most commonly found are breast cancer and cervical cancer. So if you havenâ€™t got your mother, sister or yourself checked recently, book an appointment today. Early detection is the best way to beat cancer.</p>

        <img src="bcdata.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
        </div>
        <p>Breast cancer symptoms and signs include</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a lump in the breast or armpit</li>
<li>bloody nipple discharge</li>
</li>inverted nipple</li>
</li>orange-peel texture or dimpling of the breast's skin</li>
</li>breast pain or sore nipple</li>
</li>swollen lymph nodes in the neck or armpit</li>
</li>a change in the size or shape of the breast or nipple.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What causes breast cancer?</h2>
        
        <p>There are many risk factors that increase the chance of developing breast cancer. Although we know some of these risk factors, we don't know the cause of breast cancer or how these factors cause the development of a cancer cell.</p>
        
        <p>We know that normal breast cells become cancerous because of mutations in the DNA, and although some of these are inherited, most DNA changes related to breast cells are acquired during one's life.</p>
        
        <p>Proto-oncogenes help cells grow. If these cells mutate, they can increase growth of cells without any control. Such mutations are referred to as oncogenes. Such uncontrolled cell growth can lead to cancer.</p>
        
    <h2>
        The following are risk factors for breast cancer:</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Age: The chances of breast cancer increase as one gets older.
Family history: The risk of breast cancer is higher among women who have relatives with the disease. Having a close relative with the disease (sister, mother, daughter) doubles a woman's risk.</li>
<li>Personal history: Having been diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast increases the risk of cancer in the other breast or the chance of an additional cancer in the original breast.
Women diagnosed with certain benign breast conditions have an increased risk of breast cancer. These include atypical hyperplasia, a condition in which there is abnormal proliferation of breast cells but no cancer has developed.</li>
<li>Menstruation: Women who started their menstrual cycle at a younger age (before 12) or went through menopause later (after 55) have a slightly increased risk.
Breast tissue: Women with dense breast tissue (as documented by mammogram) have a higher risk of breast cancer.</li>
<li>Race: White women have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, but African-American women tend to have more aggressive tumors when they do develop breast cancer.
Exposure to previous chest radiation or use of diethylstilbestrol increases the risk of breast cancer</li>
<li>Having no children or the first child after age 30 increases the risk of breast cancer.
Breastfeeding for one and a half to two years might slightly lower the risk of breast cancer.
Being overweight or obese increases the risk of breast cancer both in pre- and postmenopausal women but at different rates.</li>
<li>Use of oral contraceptives in the last 10 years increases the risk of breast cancer slightly.</li>
<li>Using combined hormone therapy after menopause increases the risk of breast cancer.</li>
        </ul>

   <h2 id="pk2">2. Heart diseases:</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="hr.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
        </div>
        <p>Though breast cancer occupies the number one spot on this list, heart diseases too are major concerns for women globally. Although the probability of heart diseases is more in males, more number of women are increasingly being diagnosed with a weak heart. Counter the chances by following a healthy diet from an early age, a non-smoking lifestyle and daily checkups.</p>
        <p>Unlike cardiovascular disease, which describes problems with the blood vessels and circulatory system as well as the heart, heart disease refers only issues and deformities in the heart itself.</p>
        <h2>Types:</h2>
    
    <p>There are many types of heart disease that affect different parts of the organ and occur in different ways.</p>
    <h3>Congenital heart disease</h3>

<p>This is a general term for some deformities of the heart that have been present since birth. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Septal defects: There is a hole between the two chambers of the heart.</li>
    <li>bstruction defects: The flow of blood through various chambers of the heart is partially or totally blocked.</li>
    <li>Cyanotic heart disease: A defect in the heart causes a shortage of oxygen around the body.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Arrhythmia</h3>

<p>Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat.</p>

<p>There are several ways in which a heartbeat can lose its regular rhythm. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>tachycardia, when the heart beats too fast</li>
<li>bradycardia, when the heart beats too slowly</li>
<li>premature ventricular contractions, or additional, abnormal beats</li>
<li>fibrillation, when the heartbeat is irregular</li>
</ul>

<p>Arrhythmias occur when the electrical impulses in the heart that coordinate the heartbeat do not work properly. These make the heart beat in a way it should not, whether that be too fast, too slowly, or too erratically.</p>


<p>Irregular heartbeats are common, and all people experience them. They feel like a fluttering or a racing heart. However, when they change too much or occur because of a damaged or weak heart, they need to be taken more seriously and treated.</p>

<p>Arrhythmias can become fatal.</p>
   
   <h3>Coronary artery disease</h3>

<p>The coronary arteries supply the heart muscle with nutrients and oxygen by circulating blood.</p>

<p>Coronary arteries can become diseased or damaged, usually because of plaque deposits that contain cholesterol. Plaque buildup narrows the coronary arteries, and this causes the heart to receive less oxygen and nutrients.</p>

<h3>Dilated cardiomyopathy</h3>

<p>The heart chambers become dilated as a result of heart muscle weakness and cannot pump blood properly. The most common reason is that not enough oxygen reaches the heart muscle, due to coronary artery disease. This usually affects the left ventricle.</p>

<h3>Myocardial infarction</h3>

<p>This is also known as a heart attack, cardiac infarction, and coronary thrombosis. An interrupted blood flow damages or destroys part of the heart muscle. This is usually caused by a blood clot that develops in one of the coronary arteries and can also occur if an artery suddenly narrows or spasms.</p>

<h3>Heart failure</h3>

<p><p>Also known as congestive heart failure, heart failure occurs when the heart does not pump blood around the body efficiently.</p>

<p>The left or right side of the heart might be affected. Rarely, both sides are. Coronary artery disease or high blood pressure can, over time, leave the heart too stiff or weak to fill and pump properly.</p>

<h3>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</h3>

<p>This is a genetic disorder in which the wall of the left ventricle thickens, making it harder for blood to be pumped out of the heart. This is the leading cause of sudden death in athletes. A parent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has a 50 percent chance of passing the disorder on to their children.</p>

<h3>Mitral regurgitation</h3>

<p>Also known as mitral valve regurgitation, mitral insufficiency, or mitral incompetence, this occurs when the mitral valve in the heart does not close tightly enough. This allows blood to flow back into the heart when it should leave. As a result, blood cannot move through the heart or the body efficiently.</p>

<p>People with this type of heart condition often feel tired and out of breath.</p>

<h3>Mitral valve prolapse</h3>

<p>The valve between the left atrium and left ventricle does not fully close, it bulges upwards, or back into the atrium. In most people, the condition is not life-threatening, and no treatment is required. Some people, especially if the condition is marked by mitral regurgitation, may require treatment.</p>

<h3>Pulmonary stenosis</h3>

<p>It becomes hard for the heart to pump blood from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery because the pulmonary valve is too tight. The right ventricle has to work harder to overcome the obstruction. An infant with severe stenosis can turn blue. Older children will generally have no symptoms.</p>

<p>Treatment is needed if the pressure in the right ventricle is too high, and a balloon valvuloplasty or open-heart surgery may be performed to clear an obstruction.</p>
   
  <h2> Symptoms</h2>
<p>The symptoms of heart disease depend on which condition is affecting an individual.</p></p>

<p>However, common symptoms include chest pain, breathlessness, and heart palpitations. The chest pain common to many types of heart disease is known as angina, or angina pectoris, and occurs when a part of the heart does not receive enough oxygen.</p>

<p>Angina can be triggered by stressful events or physical exertion and normally lasts under 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Heart attacks can also occur as a result of different types of heart disease. The signs of a heart attack are similar to angina except that they can occur during rest and tend to be more severe.</p>

<p>The symptoms of a heart attack can sometimes resemble indigestion. Heartburn and a stomach ache can occur, as well as a heavy feeling in the chest.</p>

<p>Other symptoms of a heart attack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>pain that travels through the body, for example from the chest to the arms, neck, back, abdomen, or jaw</li>
<li>lightheadedness and dizzy sensations</li>
<li>profuse sweating</li>
   <li> nausea and vomiting</li>
</ul>
<p>Heart failure is also an outcome of heart disease, and breathlessness can occur when the heart becomes too weak to circulate blood.</p>

<p>Some heart conditions occur with no symptoms at all, especially in older adults and individuals with diabetes.</p>

<p>The term 'congenital heart disease' covers a range of conditions, but the general symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
   <li> sweating</li>
<li>high levels of fatigue</li>
<li>fast heartbeat and breathing</li>
<li>breathlessness</li>
<li>chest pain</li>
<li>a blue tint to the skin</li>
<li>clubbed fingernails</li>
</ul>
<p>In severe cases, symptoms can occur from birth. However, these symptoms might not develop until a person is older than 13 years.</p>
  <h2> Treatment</h2>
<p>There are two main lines of treatment for heart disease. Initially, a person can attempt to treat the heart condition using medications. If these do not have the desired effect, surgical options are available to help correct the issue.</p>

<h3>Medication</h3>
<p>A very wide range of medication is available for the majority of heart conditions. Many are prescribed to prevent blood clots, but some serve other purposes.</p>

<p>The main medications in use are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>statins, for lowering cholesterol</li>
<li>aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin, for preventing blood clots</li>
<li>beta-blockers, for treating heart attack, heart failure, and high blood pressure</li>
<li>angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, for heart failure and high blood pressure</li>
</ul>


<p>Your doctor will work with you to find a medication that is safe and effective. They will also use medications to treat underlying conditions that can affect the heart, such as diabetes before they become problematic.</p>

<h3>Surgery</h3>
<p>Surgeons doing surgery
Heart surgery is an option for people with heart disease, but it can be debilitating.
    Heart surgery is an intensive option from which it can take a long time to recover.</p>

<p>However, they can be effective in treating blockages and heart problems for which medications may not be effective, especially in the advanced stages of heart disease.</p>

<p>The most common surgeries include:</p>
<ul>
   <li> angioplasty, in which a balloon catheter is inserted to widen narrowed blood vessels that might be restricting blood flow to the heart</li>
<li>coronary artery bypass surgery, which allows blood flow to reach a blocked part of the heart in people with blocked arteries</li>
<li>surgery to repair or replace faulty heart valves</li>
<li>pacemakers, or electronic machines that regulate a heartbeat for people with arrhythmia</li>
</ul>
<p>Heart transplants are another option. However, it is often difficult to find a suitable heart of the right size and blood type in the required time. People are put on a waiting list for donor organs and can sometimes wait years.</p>


<h2 id="pk3">3. Maternal Health:</h2>
  <div>
   <img src="mh.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
   </div>
   <p>In a country like India, where maternal care is just achieving due notice, the risks of infection and complication pre and post pregnancy are high. Maternal care involves healthy living during the entire nine months of pregnancy. </p>
   
   
   <p>n smaller towns and villages, more women die of insufficient healthcare during pregnancy than any other diseases.  Luckily, with more medical centres opening in such disease-prone areas, and with growing awareness about maternal health, this number is less scary than it was a decade ago.</p>
   <p>ndiaâ€™s maternal mortality rate reduced from 212 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2007 to 167 deaths in 2013. The advance is largely due to key government interventions such as the Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) scheme which encompasses free maternity services for women and children, a nationwide scale-up of emergency referral systems and maternal death audits, and improvements in the governance and management of health services at all levels.</p>

<p>However, adolescent and illiterate mothers and those living in hard to reach areas still have a much greater chance of dying in childbirth. Adolescent girls outside Indian cities are especially vulnerable as teenage marriage and pregnancies are very high in rural and remote areas of the country.  
 </p>
   
   <h3>DANGER SIGNS DURING PREGNANCY</h3>
<p>If any of the following signs occur, the woman should be taken immediately to the hospital or health centre.</p>
<ul>
<li>vaginal bleeding</li>
<li>convulsions/fits</li>
<li>severe headaches with blurred vision</li>
<li>fever and too weak to get out of bed</li>
<li>severe abdominal pain</li>
  <li>  fast or difficult breathing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If she has any of these signs she should go to the health centre as soon as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Abdominal pain</li>
<li>Feels ill</li>
<li>Swelling of fingers, face and legs</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Treatment</h2>
   <p> UNICEF India supports capacity-building and on-the-job coaching (supportive supervision) for improved maternal health. In 2013 and 2014, in addition to supporting courses for skilled birth attendants, UNICEF supported the MoHFW to pioneer a short-term training for midwives and doctors on maternal health using models and dummies.</p>

<p>First-ever skills labs in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh were supported by UNICEF. The learnings from these skills lab fed into national guidelines and directives and, eventually, the establishment of four national skills labs that cater to all states in India. UNICEF will continue to support capacity-building using such approaches to ensure that women, especially pregnant women and adolescents, receive quality services with dignity. </p>
 
<p>Utilization with equity of Maternal Health Services: UNICEF India supports the capacities of health managers and supervisors at district and block-level to plan, implement, monitor and supervise effective maternal health care services with a focus on high-risk pregnant women and those in hard-to-reach communities. The evidence generated from this supportive supervision and monitoring then feeds in the regular planning and supply management for health facilities.</p> 
  
    <h2 id="pk4">4. Depression and Mental Health:</h2>
    <div>
    <img src="dm.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
    </div>
<p>Studies suggest that more women suffer from issues of mental health than men. Mental health includes depression, anxiety, insomnia, hypertension and hormonal problems.</p>

<p>Studies suggest that depression may hit women post pregnancy, due to some major life tragedy, and during menopause. Therapy and pushing yourself to live a positive, healthy lifestyle is the solution. </p>
  
  
   <p>In India, depression is slowly being recognised as a real disease with symptoms and treatment, with more people coming out to talk about their problems. This is giving impetus to treatment of this disease.</p>
  <h2>What Causes Depression in Women?</h2>
<p>There are a multitude of genetic, hormonal, psychological, and social factors that come into play when citing the cause of depression in women.</p>

<h3>Biology and Hormones</h3>
<p>Biologically speaking, depression runs in families â€“ with scientific evidence that some genetic makeups are more prone to depression, whereas some genetic makeups are more resistant to it. Though, environmental factors are thought to interact with genetic predispositions. That is, just because you may be more prone to depression because of your genes, healthy family and social relationships can increase resilience.</p>

<p>Other biological and hormonal factors are also likely to increase your chances of suffering from depression. Issues with pregnancy, fertility, perimenopause, menopause, and menstrual cycles increase womenâ€™s risk factors of developing depression. Most of these are due to hormonal imbalances and rapid fluctuations in reproductive hormones. Health problems, in general, especially those of chronic illness or disability can prompt depression in women, as can medical life changes â€“ such as frequent dieting and smoking cessation.</p>

<h3>Psychological Causes</h3>
<p>Women are more prone to psychological causes of depression than men. With a tendency to be more emotional, women are more likely to rehash negative thoughts during bouts of depression. While it is a normal response to cry, talk with friends, and rehash why it is you are in your depressive state, research has shown that ruminating about depression can cause it to last longer and even make it worse. In contrast, men tend to distract themselves from their depressive state â€“ which has been shown to reduce the duration of symptoms. Additional psychological factors that tend to affect women over men are negative body images and stress-induced depression. Women are more prone to stress than men because their increased levels of progesterone have been shown to prevent stress hormones from leveling out. Negative body image issues usually begin in adolescence and seem to be correlated with the onset of puberty in women.</p>

<h3>Social Causes</h3>
<p>Coping skills, choice of relationships, and lifestyle choices affect women differently than men. As a woman, you are more likely to develop depression from marital or relationship problems, work-life balance issues, financial troubles, and stressful life events, including the loss of a loved one.</p>

<p>In addition to the biological, psychological, and social causes of depression mentioned above, the National Institutes of Health indicate the following are also increased risk factors of depression in women:</p>
<ul>
<li>Death of a parent before age 10</li>
<li>Job loss, relationship problems, divorce</li>
<li>Physical or sexual abuse during childhood</li>
<li>History of mood disorders</li>
<li>Use of certain medications</li>
</ul>
  <h2> Signs and Symptoms</h2>
<p>Signs and symptoms of depression vary from woman to woman. Some of the most common signs and symptoms are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feelings of emptiness, hopelessness, despair, and sadness</li>
<li>Irritability, anxiousness, and guilt</li>
<li>Feelings of exhaustion, severe tiredness</li>
<li>Loss of interest in previously pleasurable activities</li>
<li>Inability to concentrate or remember details</li>
<li>Suicidal thoughts or attempts of suicide</li>
<li>Sleep disturbances; sleeping too much or too little, insomnia</li>
<li>Changes in appetite â€“ eating too much or too little</li>
<li>Physical symptoms â€“ aches and pains, cramps, headaches, digestive issues, breast tenderness, bloating</li>
<li>Lack of energy</li>
<li>Feeling out of control</li>
<li>Mood swings and feelings of tearfulness</li>
<li>Panic attacks</li>
<li>Feelings of tension</li>
<li>Disinterest in daily activities and relationships</li>
</ul>
<h2>Treatment Options</h2>

<p>If you are a woman and suffering from depression, it is best to seek treatment right away to improve your quality of life. Your first course of action should be a visit to your doctor or mental health professional. Your doctor will ask you a series of questions and perform tests to rule out an underlying medical condition causing your depression or determine if certain medications might be to blame for your depressed mental state. Your primary care doctor will also ask you a number of questions about your symptoms â€“ how long they have lasted, when they started, the severity of your symptoms, how persistent they are (re-occurrence rate), and your family history of depression. If your doctor suspects you may be suffering from depression, he or she will refer you to a mental health specialist who can formally diagnose your condition and make recommendations for treatment.</p>

<p>The most common treatment options for women suffering from depression include medications and therapy. It is imperative you tell your doctor if you are pregnant or may become pregnant during treatment as certain medications to treat depression may affect your growing baby. If you are depressed, your doctor may prescribe you antidepressants to help you cope and to lessen the symptoms of your depression. If you do begin taking antidepressants for your depressed mood state, it is important that you monitor your symptoms and note any side effects. Certain side effects of antidepressants can worsen depression in a small percentage of individuals. Specifically, increased risk of suicidal thoughts, suicidal attempts, and irritability have found to be associated with the use of antidepressants in some individuals. Other more common side effects include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Headaches</li>
    <li>Sleep disturbances</li>
    <li>Agitation</li>
    <li>Sexual problems</li>
<li>Though, these problems usually decrease over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therapy has also been shown to be a very effective method of treatment if you are suffering from depression. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most common forms of talk therapy, or psychotherapy, in the treatment of depression. This method of therapy focuses on teaching new ways of thinking and coping mechanisms when feelings of depression hit. In addition, therapy is helpful in helping women understand difficult relationships and how to improve them, and how to change habits that might be contributing to their depression. In addition to one-on-one therapy, group therapy or family therapy is a helpful method to treat depression if family stress is a contributing factor to your depressed state.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, depression in women can have misdiagnosis rates as high as 50% and fewer than half of women who experience major depression will ever seek treatment. Fortunately, depression has shown great treatment success rates. More than 80% of women with depression are treated successfully through antidepressants, therapy, or a combination of both.</p>

<p>In addition to medications and therapy, the self-help techniques below can help improve your mood if you are suffering from depression:</p>

<p>Donâ€™t keep your feelings bottled up â€“ find a support group with people you trust
Stay engaged in social activities and social functions
Exercise regularly</p>
<p>Get enough sleep â€“ 8 hours per night is ideal
Meditate, try yoga, or practice other relaxation techniques
If you or a loved one are suffering from depression, you are not alone. Seek help for your depressed mood to elevate your quality of life. If you are unsure who to contact, try the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family doctors</li>
<li>Employee assistance programs</li>
<li>Mental health centers</li>
<li>Social agencies</li>
<li>Mental health specialists (psychiatrists, social workers, mental health counselors)</li>
<li>Private clinics</li>
<li>State hospital outpatient clinics</li>
<li>Health maintenance organizations</li>
</ul>

   <div>
   <img src="std.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
   </div>
   <p>Diseases such as AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhoea are all transmitted during the act of sex. Unfortunately, women bear the brunt of these diseases more than men. These diseases; especially HIV, increase the chances of contracting tuberculosis, and reduce life expectancy. </p>
<h2>How does HIV/AIDS affect women?</h2>
<b>Infection</b>
<p>Throughout the world, HIV is most often spread through sex.1 Women may be at greater risk of being infected with HIV during sexual contact than men are. This is because the fragile tissues of the vagina can tear slightly during sex and let the virus enter the body. (This is especially likely among girls under age 18.) The vagina also has a large surface area that can be exposed to the virus, thus increasing risk of infection. Similarly, anal tissues are also fragile and prone to tearing slightly during sex. Women are at higher risk of infection via anal sex than by vaginal sex with an infected man. Most women around the world and in the United States who have HIV were infected through sex with a man.</p>

<p>Forced sex, transactional sex, and marriage to much older men increase women's risk of infection in many places around the world. The World Health Organization has more information on gender inequality and HIV External Web Site Policy.</p>

<p>Having multiple sex partners can also increase the risk of exposure to the virus that causes the disease. Injection drug use is another way HIV can be acquired by women.</p>
   <h2>Symptoms</h2>
  <p>The most common HIV symptoms in women in this stage include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Body rash</li>
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Sore throat</li>
   <li>Severe headaches</li>
</ul>
<p>Less common HIV symptoms in women in this stage include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
    <li>Nausea</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Ulcers in the mouth</li>
    <li>Vaginal infections, like yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis</li>
    <li>Night sweats</li>
    <li>Vomiting</li>
    <li>Muscle aches and joint pain</li>
</ul>
   <h2>Treatment</h2>
   <p>Treatment consists of HIV antivirals
No cure exists for AIDS, but strict adherence to antiretroviral regimens (ARVs) can dramatically slow the disease's progress as well as prevent secondary infections and complications.</p>
</b>Medications</b>
<b>HIV antiviral</b>
<p>Suppresses HIV to slow progression of infection. Reduces the risk of infecting others.</p>
<b>Specialists</b>
<p>Infectious Disease Doctor</p>
<p>Treats infections, including those that are tropical in nature.</p>
<b>Clinical Psychologist</b>
<p>Treats mental disorders primarily with talk therapy.</p>
<b>Primary Care Provider (PCP)</b>

<h2 id="pk6">6. Diabetes:</h2>
<div>
<img src="dib.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
</div>
<p>This disease, again though more prevalent in men, sometimes goes undiagnosed in women. This is more cause for concern. Diabetes; especially type 2, is seen more in women who follow an unhealthy lifestyle. Type 2 is caused by obesity, weight issues, smoking, alcohol abuse, among other things.  </p>
   <p>Diabetes describes a group of metabolic diseases in which a person has high blood sugar due to problems processing or producing insulin. Diabetes can affect anyone, regardless of age, race, gender, or lifestyle.</p>

<p>Between 1971 and 2000, the death rate for men with diabetes fell, according to a study in Annals of Internal Medicine. This was a major coup, reflecting the many advances in diabetes treatment. However, according to the study, the death rate for women with diabetes showed no signs of improvement. Additionally, the difference in death rates between women who had diabetes and those who didnâ€™t more than doubled.</p>

<p>This study of diabetes in men and women presented several possible reasons for the gender differences. Reasons included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Women often receive less aggressive treatment for cardiovascular risk factors and conditions related to diabetes.</li>
      <li>The complications of diabetes in women are more difficult to diagnose.</li>
      <li>Women often have different kinds of heart disease than men.</li>
   <li> Hormones and inflammation act differently in women.</li>
   <li> The findings emphasize how diabetes affects women and men differently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the death rate was higher among women previously, there has been a shift in gender distribution of type two diabetes showing higher rates among men. The most current reported stats (in 2012) found that 13.4 million women and 15.5 million men have been diagnosed with diabetes in the United States alone.</p>

<p>According to the global reports from the World Health Organization from 2014, there was an estimated 422 million adults living with diabetes. This is up from 108 million that was reported in 1980.</p>
 <h2> Symptoms </h2> 

<h3> Vaginal and oral yeast infections and vaginal thrush</h3>
<p>An overgrowth of yeast caused by the candida fungus can cause vaginal yeast infections, oral yeast infections, and vaginal thrush. These infections are common in women.</p>

<p>When the infection develops in the vaginal area, symptoms include itching, soreness, vaginal discharge, and painful sex. Oral yeast infections often cause a cottage-cheese coating on the tongue and inside of the mouth. High levels of glucose in the blood triggers the growth of fungus.</p>

 <h3> Urinary infections</h3>
<p>The risk of a urinary tract infection (UTI) is higher in women who have diabetes. UTIs develop when bacteria enters the urinary tract. These infections can cause painful urination, a burning sensation, and bloody or cloudy urine. If left untreated, thereâ€™s the risk of a kidney infection.</p>

<p>UTIs are common with diabetes due to poor circulation and the inability of white blood cells to travel through the bloodstream and kill infections.</p>

<h3>Female sexual dysfunction</h3> 
<p>Diabetic neuropathy occurs when high blood glucose damages nerve fibers. This can trigger tingling and loss of feeling in different parts of the body, including the hands, feet, and legs. This condition may also affect sensation in the vaginal area and lower a womanâ€™s sex drive.</p>

<h3>Polycystic ovary syndrome</h3>
<p>This disorder occurs when the adrenal gland produces a higher amount of male hormones. Signs of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) include irregular periods, weight gain, acne, and depression. It can also cause infertility and a type of insulin resistance. This results in elevated blood sugar levels and increases the risk of developing diabetes.</p>
   <h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>At all stages of life, womenâ€™s bodies present obstacles for managing diabetes and blood sugar. Challenges may occur because:</p>

<p>The fluctuating hormones associated with the menstrual cycle, childbearing, and menopause make it more difficult to maintain proper blood glucose levels. To keep your blood glucose at a healthy level, check your blood sugar several times a day the week before, during, and after your period. Do this for a few months, and then adjust your insulin dose as needed.
Some birth control pills can increase blood glucose. To maintain a healthy level of blood glucose, ask your doctor about switching to a low-dose birth control pill.
Glucose in your body can cause yeast infections. This is because glucose speeds the growth of fungus. There are over-the-counter and prescription medications to treat yeast infections. You can potentially avoid yeast infections altogether by maintaining better control of your blood sugar. Take insulin as prescribed, exercise regularly, reduce your carb intake, choose low-glycemic foods, and monitor your blood sugar.</p>
<p>There are steps you can take to prevent or delay diabetes, avoid its complications, and manage symptoms.</p>

<h3>Medications</h3>
<p>There are a variety of medications you can take to manage the symptoms and complications of diabetes. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>insulin therapy</li>
<li>metformin (Glucophage), which reduces blood sugar</li>
<li>sulfonylureas like chlorpropamide, which increase pancreatic insulin secretion</li>
   <li> meglitinides, which stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin</li>
    <li>Lifestyle changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Many find that lifestyle changes can help them manage their diabetes. Lifestyle changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>exercising and maintaining a healthy weight</li>
<li>avoiding smoking cigarettes</li>
<li>eating a diet focused on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</li>
<li>monitoring your blood sugar</li>
  <li>  Alternative remedies</li>
</ul>
<p>Women with diabetes can try a variety of alternative remedies to manage their symptoms. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>taking supplements like chromium or magnesium</li>
<li>eating more broccoli, buckwheat, sage, peas, and fenugreek seeds</li>
<li>taking plant supplements</li>
</ul>
Remember to consult with your doctor before trying any new treatments. Even if theyâ€™re natural, they can interfere with current treatments or medications
  <h2 id="pk7">7. Vaginal Infections:</h2>
  <div>
  <img src="vg.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
  </div>
  <p>If you have itchiness and swelling around your vagina, you may be falling prey to one of the most under-rated, yet major diseases affecting women. Vaginitis, which may be caused due to infections, uncomfortable clothing, sexual activity, or extreme illness, is a growing cause for concern.</p>
  <p>Vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina, often due to vaginal infections that creates discharge, odor, irritation, or itching. It is difficult to diagnose because vaginitis has many causes. Women use a variety of over-the-counter medications to treat the itching, discharge, and discomfort of these conditions.</p>
<p>The vagina creates its own environment and maintains a balance among the normal bacteria found there and the hormonal changes in a woman's body. Vaginitis occurs when the vaginal ecosystem has been changed by certain medications such as antibiotics, hormones, contraceptive preparations (oral and topical), douches, vaginal medication, sexual intercourse, sexually transmitted diseases, stress, and change in sexual partners.</p>
<p>Some vaginal infections are transmitted through sexual contact, but others, such as yeast infections, probably are not. Vaginitis means inflammation and is often caused by infections, but may be due to hormonal changes (especially when a woman is going through menopause) or due to trauma in young girls. Some infections are associated with more serious diseases.</p>
<p>Three types of vaginal infections are the most common. Their causes are quite different but, their signs and symptoms are similar, and treatments of the three conditions vary.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bacterial vaginosis</li>
    <li>Vaginal yeast infection</li>
    <li>Trichomoniasis</li>
</ul>
<p>Many women often mistakenly think they have a "yeast infection" and treat themselves when, in fact, they have a similar vaginal infection that will not respond to self-treatment with over-the-counter yeast medications. A study by the American Sexual Health Association reported that 62 percent of women mistake bacterial vaginosis for a yeast infection prior to diagnosis.
The important thing is not to guess, but to recognize the symptoms if you develop a vaginal infection. If you have any concerns, see your healthcare practitioner for precise testing and to get the most appropriate and effective treatment right away.</p>
 <h2>Symptoms</h2>
  <p>If your vaginal discharge is abnormal in color such as green, has a foul smell, changes consistency, or is significantly increased or decreased in amount, you may be developing a form of vaginitis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) causes an abnormal vaginal discharge with an unpleasant odor. Some women report a strong fishy smell, especially after intercourse. The discharge is usually white or gray, and it can be thin. You may also have burning during urination or itching around the outside of the vagina, or both. Some women with bacterial vaginosis may have no symptoms.</li>

<li>Yeast infections or candidiasis may cause a thick, whitish-gray "cottage cheese" type of vaginal discharge with accompanying itching. The itching may be intense. Painful urination and intercourse are also common. A vaginal discharge may not be present. Men with genital candidiasis may have an itchy rash on the penis. Most male partners of women with yeast infection do not experience any symptoms.</li>

<li>Trichomoniasis results in a frothy vaginal discharge that may be yellow-green or gray. The infection may cause itching and irritation of the genitals, burning with urination (sometimes confused with a urinary tract infection), discomfort during intercourse, and a foul odor. Trichomoniasis is sexually-transmitted, and symptoms generally appear within 4-20 days after exposure. Men rarely have symptoms, but if they do, they may have a thin, whitish discharge from the penis accompanied by painful or difficult urination.</li>

<li>Pain itself is not a frequent symptom of vaginal infections (except for the itching) and should prompt you to see your health care practitioner.</li>

<li>If you have a condition called vulvodynia, you may have burning, stinging, irritation, or rawness of your genitalia. Vulvodynia is defined by symptoms, and there is frequently no infection or skin disease of the vulva or vagina. You may have intermittent pain, off and on. This is an unusual condition that requires further management with your health care practitioner.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Treatment</h2>
<p> Diagnosis is usually made based on your symptoms and results of urine tests and, occasionally, vaginal cultures (samples sent to the lab). Treatment is based on the organism causing the infection. Depending on the cause of the infection, your health care practitioner may prescribe vaginal suppositories, antifungal pills, or antibiotics (as pills or an injection). Treatment varies depending on which form of vaginitis you have, the severity of infection, duration of infection, recurrence of infection, and whether you are pregnant.</p>

<p>Follow up with your doctor for results of your cervical lab tests and Pap test. It is recommended that you have a complete physical examination every year, whether or not you are experiencing any symptoms.</p>
  <p>Each yeast infection is different, so your doctor will suggest a treatment thatâ€™s best for you. Treatments are generally determined based on the severity of your symptoms.</p>

<h3>Simple infections</h3>
<p>For simple yeast infections, your doctor will usually prescribe a 1-3 day regimen of an antifungal cream, ointment, tablet, or suppository. These medications can be in prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) form.</p>

<p>Common medications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>butoconazole (Gynazole)</li>
<li>miconazole (Lotrimin)</li>
<li>Monistat</li>
<li>terconazole (Terazol)</li>
   <li> fluconazole (Diflucan)</li>
</ul>
<p>Women with simple yeast infections should follow up with their doctors to make sure the medicine worked. A follow-up will also be necessary if your symptoms return within two months. If you recognize that you have a yeast infection, you can also treat yourself at home with OTC products.</p>

<h3>Complicated infections</h3>
<p>Your doctor will more than likely treat your yeast infection as if it were a severe or complicated case, if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have severe redness, swelling, and itching that leads to sores or tears in your vaginal tissue</li>
<li>have had more than four yeast infections in a year</li>
<li>have infection caused by Candida other than albicans</li></li>
<li>are pregnant</li>
<li>have uncontrolled diabetes or a weak immune system from medication</li>
    are HIV-positive</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible treatments for severe or complicated yeast infections include:</p>
<ul>
<li>14-day cream, ointment, tablet, or suppository vaginal treatment</li>
<li>two or three doses of fluconazole (Diflucan)</li>
<li>long-term prescription of fluconazole (Diflucan) taken once a week for six weeks, or long-term use of a topical antifungal medication</li>
</ul>
<p>If your infection is recurring, you may also want to see if your sexual partner has a yeast infection. Remember to use condoms when having sex if you suspect either of you has a yeast infection.</p>
   <h2 id="pk8">8. Pre-Menstrual Syndrome (PMS):</h2>
   <div>
   <img src="pms.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
   </div>
   <p>Yes guys. Itâ€™s a real thing. Real enough to even make it to this list. During every womanâ€™s menstrual cycle; along with cramps, muscle illness, tiredness and body ache, the frequent mood swings may be more serious than you think. If the pain and the depression is hitting you hard, you may be suffering from Premenstrual Dysphoric disorder which is a stronger form of PMS.</p>
   <p>Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a condition that affects a womanâ€™s emotions, physical health, and behavior during certain days of the menstrual cycle, generally just before her menses. PMS is a very common condition. Its symptoms affect up to 85 percent of menstruating women. It must impair some aspect of your life for your doctor to diagnose you.</p>

<p>PMS symptoms start five to 11 days before menstruation and typically go away once menstruation begins. The cause of PMS is unknown. However, many researchers believe that itâ€™s related to a change in both sex hormone and serotonin levels at the beginning of the menstrual cycle.</p>

<p>Levels of estrogen and progesterone increase during certain times of the month. An increase in these hormones can cause mood swings, anxiety, and irritability. Ovarian steroids also modulate activity in parts of your brain associated with premenstrual symptoms.</p>

<p>Serotonin levels affect mood. Serotonin is a chemical in your brain and gut that affects your moods, emotions, and thoughts.</p>
<p><b>Risk factors </b>for premenstrual syndrome include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a history of depression or mood disorders, such as postpartum depression or bipolar disorder</li>
<li>a family history of PMS</li>
<li>a family history of depression</li>
<li>domestic violence</li>
<li>substance abuse</li>
 <li>   physical trauma</li>
  <li>  emotional trauma</li>
</ul>
<h2>Symptoms </h2>
  <p> A womanâ€™s menstrual cycle lasts an average of 28 days. Ovulation, the period when an egg is released from the ovaries, occurs on day 14 of the cycle. Menstruation, or bleeding, occurs on day 28 of the cycle. PMS symptoms can begin around day 14 and last until seven days after the start of menstruation.</p>

<p>The symptoms of PMS are usually mild or moderate. Nearly 80 percent of women report one or more symptom that does not substantially affect daily functioning, according to the journal American Family Physician. Twenty to 32 percent of women report moderate to severe symptoms that affect some aspect of life. Three to 8 percent report PMDD. The severity of symptoms can vary by individual and by month. The symptoms of PMS include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  abdominal bloating</li>
<li>abdominal pain</li>
<li>sore breasts</li>
<li>acne</li>
<li>food cravings, especially for sweets</li>
<li>constipation</li>
<li>diarrhea</li>
<li>headaches</li></li>
<li>sensitivity to light or sound</li>
<li>fatigue</li>
<li>irritability</li>
<li>changes in sleep patterns</li>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>depression</li>
<li>sadness</li>
<li>emotional outbursts</li>
</ul>
   <h2>Treatments</h2>
   <p>Treatment consists of self care and anti-inflammatories</p>
<p>Lifestyle changes and medication may reduce symptoms.</p>
<h3>Medications</h3>
<p>Birth control, Nonsteroidal anti-Inflammatory drug, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI), and Hormone</p>
<h3>Self-care</h3>
<p><b>Physical exercise</b></p>
<p>Aerobic activity for 20â€“30 minutes 5 days a week improves cardiovascular health. If injured, pursuing an activity that avoids the injured muscle group or joint can help maintain physical function while recovering.</p>
<h3>Therapies</h3>
<p><b>Cognitive behavioral therapy</b></p>
<p>A talk therapy focused on modifying negative thoughts, behaviours and emotional responses associated with psychological distress.</p>
<h3>Specialists</h3>
<p><b>Primary Care Provider (PCP)</b></p>
