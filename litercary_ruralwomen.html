	<h2 id="heading">Women Education in Rural India: Meaning, Need and Barriers</h2>
		<p>India’s Constitution guarantees free primary school education for both boys and girls up to age 14. This goal has been repeatedly reconfirmed, but primary education in India is not universal. Overall, the literacy rate for women is 39 percent versus 64 percent for men with less than 40 percent of the 330 million women aged seven and above being literate, according to the 1991 census, which means today there are over 200 million illiterate women in India.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>The urban female literacy rate is 64 percent and rural women literacy rate is half of it, i.e., 31 percent. As with India as a whole, many states have large rural-urban differences in female literacy. In six of the 24 states, 25 percent or less of the women in rural areas are literate. In Rajasthan, less than 12 percent of rural women are literate. This low level of literacy not only has a negative impact on women’s lives but also on their families’ and country’s economic development.</p><br><br>
		<h2 id="heading">Need for Education for Rural Women:</h2>
		<p>Numerous studies show that illiterate women have high levels of fertility and mortality, poor nutritional status, low earning potential, and little autonomy within the household. A woman’s lack of education also has a negative impact on the health and well-being of her children. For instance, a recent survey in India found out that infant mortality is inversely related to mother’s educational level.<br><br>

Therefore, there is a need for minimum threshold of education (more than 5 or 6 years) that must be achieved before bringing about significant improvements in female autonomy. Of the literate women in India, 59 percent only have primary education or less. This level of education may not be sufficient to meaningfully improve the status of these women.</p><br><br>
<h2 id="heading">Barriers for Female Education:</h2>
<h4 id="pinki">There are four major barriers for girls’ education in India. They are as follows:</h4>
<p><em id="sub">High Dropout Rate:</em><br><br>
The major educational problem faced by girls, especially girls from rural areas, is that although they may be enrolled at the beginning of the year, they do not always remain in school. It is estimated that 45 percent of girls dropout of school between grades 1 and 5 (The World Bank, 1997b). Girls are often taken out of school to share the family respon­sibilities such as caring for younger siblings, etc.<br><br>
Girls are also likely to be taken out of school, when they reach puberty because of the high premium placed on virginity. The data on school attendance collected by the World Bank in 1997 shows the proportion of girls attending school decreases with age. In 1992-93, only 55 percent of girls aged 11-14 were attending school compared with 61 percent of the younger age group.<br><br><em id="sub">Priority to Son’s Education Compared to Daughter’s Education:</em><br><br>
If a family has to choose between educating a son or a daughter because of financial restrictions, typically the son will be chosen. Negative parental attitudes towards educating daughters can also be a barrier to a girl’s education.<br><br>
Many parents view educating sons as an investment because the sons will be responsible for caring for aging parents. On the other hand, parents may see the education of daughters a waste of money as daughters will eventually live with their husbands’ families, and the parents will not benefit directly from their education. In addition, daughters with higher levels of education will likely have higher dowry expenses, as they will want a comparably educated husband.<br><br><em id="sub">Lack of Adequate Number of Female Teachers:</em><br><br>
Lack of female teachers is another potential barrier to girls’ education. Girls are more likely to attend school and have higher academic achievement, if they have female teachers. Currently, women account for only 29 percent of teachers at the primary level (MHRD, 1993).<br><br>
The proportion of teachers, who are female, is even lower at the university level, i.e., 22 percent (CSO 1992). These proportions reflect the historic paucity of women with the educational qualifications to be teachers. However, the proportions are likely to change in the future, as women currently account for nearly half of those being trained as teachers.<br><br>
<em id="sub">Gender Bias in Curriculum Still Exists:</em><br><br>
As far back as 1965, the Indian government agreed to rewrite textbooks so that men and women would not be portrayed in gender-stereotyped roles. However, a study of Indian textbooks done in the 1980s found that men were the main characters in the majority of lessons. In these lessons, men held high-prestige occupations and were portrayed as strong, adventurous and intelligent.<br><br>

In contrast, when women were included, they were depicted as weak and helpless, often as the victims of abuse and beatings. These depictions are strong barriers for improving women’s position in society.<br><br>

In India, the status of the girl child has been a subject of much discussion, controversy and debate. There are some overwhelming cultural and economic reasons why female children are not receiving the same medical, emotional and educational attention as their male counterparts.<br><br>

To answer this, let’s look at one common Indian proverb, ‘raising girls is like watering someone else’s lawn’. From the start, girl children are seen as burdens rather than blessings, bearers of exorbitant dowries, who will eventually move into the homes of their husbands. The result is low literacy rate among women.<br><br>

By 1991, 39 percent of women and 64 percent of men were literate (RGCC, 1993). Thus, there has been a large increase in the proportion of women, who are literate in just 20 years. Despite the improvements in literacy, there continues to be a large gap between the literacy levels of men and women in India.<br><br>
