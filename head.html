       <h1>BRAIN DISORDER</h1>
       <h2>What are brain disorders?</h2>
       <p>Your brain is your body’s control center. It’s part of the nervous system, which also includes the spinal cord and a large network of nerves and neurons. Together, the nervous system controls everything from your senses to the muscles throughout your body.</p>
       
       
       
       <p>When your brain is damaged, it can affect many different things, including your memory, your sensation, and even your personality. Brain disorders include any conditions or disabilities that affect your brain.This includes conditions that are caused by:</p>
       
       <ul>
         <li>illness</li> 
         <li>genetics</li> 
         <li>traumatic injury</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>What are the different types of brain disorders?</h2>
       
       
       <b>Brain injuries</b>
       <p>Brain injuries are often caused by blunt trauma. Trauma can damage brain tissue, neurons, and nerves. This damage affects your brain’s ability to communicate with the rest of your body. </p>
       
       
        <p>Examples of brain injuries include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>hematomas</li>
            <li>blood clots</li>
             <li>contusions, or bruising of brain tissue</li>
               <li>cerebral edema, or swelling inside the skull</li>
               <li>concussions</li>
               <li>strokes</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        Examples of the symptoms of a brain injury include:
        <ul>
       <li> vomiting </li>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>speech difficulty</li>
<li>bleeding from the ear</li>
<li>numbness</li>
<li>paralysis</li>
<li>memory loss</li>
<li>problems with concentration</li>
   </ul>
   
   
<h2>Brain tumors</h2>
   <p>Sometimes, tumors form in the brain and can be very dangerous. These are called primary brain tumors. In other cases, cancer somewhere else in your body spreads to your brain. These are called secondary or metastatic brain tumors.

Brain tumors can be either malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous). Doctors classify brain tumors as grades 1, 2, 3, or 4. Higher numbers indicate more aggressive tumors.

The cause of brain tumors is largely unknown. They can occur in people of any age. Symptoms of brain tumors depend on the size and location of the tumor. The most common symptoms of brain tumors are:</p>
   <ul>
       <li>headaches</li>
       <li>seizures</li>
       <li>numbness or tingling in your arms or legs</li>
       <li>nausea</li>
       <li>vomiting</li>
       <li>changes in personality</li>
       <li>difficulty with movement or balance</li>
<li>changes in your hearing, speech, or vision</li>
   </ul>
   The main types of treatment for brain tumors are:
   
   <ul>
       <li>surgery</li>
<li>chemotherapy</li>
<li>radiation therapy</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Neurodegenerative diseases</h2>
   <p>Neurodegenerative diseases cause your brain and nerves to deteriorate over time. They can change your personality and cause confusion. They can also destroy your brain’s tissue and nerves.

Some brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, may develop as you age. They can slowly impair your memory and thought processes. Other diseases, such as Tay-Sachs disease, are genetic and begin at an early age</p>
  
  Other common neurodegenerative diseases include:
   <ul>
       <li>Huntington’s disease</li>
<li>ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), or Lou Gehrig’s disease</li>
<li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
<li>all forms of dementia</li>
   </ul>
   Some of the more common symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases include:
   
   <ul>
       <li>memory loss</li>
<li>forgetfulness</li>
<li>apathy</li>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>agitation</li>
<li>a loss of inhibition</li>
<li>mood changes</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Neurodegenerative diseases cause permanent damage, so symptoms tend to get worse as the disease progresses. New symptoms are also likely to develop over time.

  There’s no cure for neurodegenerative diseases, but treatment can still help. Treatment for these diseases tries to reduce symptoms and maintain quality of life. Treatment often involves the use of medications to control symptoms.</p>
   
       
   <h2>Mental disorders</h2>
   
   
<p>Mental disorders, or mental illnesses, are a large and diverse group of conditions that affect your behavior patterns. Some of the most frequently diagnosed mental disorders are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>depression</li>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>bipolar disorder</li>
<li>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
<li>schizophrenia</li>
</ul>
<p>The symptoms of mental disorders vary based on the condition. Different people can experience the same mental disorders very differently. You should talk to your doctor if you notice a change in your behavior, thought patterns, or moods.</p>

<p>The two major types of treatment for mental disorders are medication and psychotherapy. Different methods work better for different conditions. Many people find that a combination of the two is the most effective.</p>

<p>If you think you might have a mental disorder, it’s important to talk to your doctor to come up with a treatment plan that works for you. There are many resources available — don’t try to self-medicate.</p>
  <h2> How are brain disorders diagnosed?</h2>
        <p>Your primary care physician or a neurological specialist can diagnose a brain disorder.</p>

<p>Your doctor will likely perform a neurological exam to check your vision, hearing, and balance. Your doctor may also get images of your brain to help them make a diagnosis. The most common diagnostic imaging tools are CT, MRI, and PET scans.</p>

<p>Your doctor might also need to study fluid from your brain and spinal cord. This helps them find bleeding in the brain, infection, and other abnormalities.</p>

<p>Mental health disorders are usually diagnosed based on an evaluation of your symptoms and history.</p>
        <h2>What’s the long-term outlook?</h2>
<p>The outlook for people with brain disorders depends on the type and severity of the brain disorder. Some conditions are easily treated with medication and therapy. For example, millions of people with mental disorders live perfectly normal lives.</p>

<p>Other disorders, like neurodegenerative diseases and some traumatic brain injuries, have no cure. People with these conditions often face permanent changes in their behavior, mental abilities, or coordination. In these cases, treatment will try to help you manage your illness and retain as much independence as possible.</p>
